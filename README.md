# My Electron-Express Playground
This is a simple project that combines Electron and Express frameworks, intended as a playground for experimentation and learning.

# Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hknakata/my-electron-app.git

```

3. Install the project dependencies:
